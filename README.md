# Design-and-Verification-of-Memory-using-SV-and-UVM

The project focuses on the functional verification of a configurable single-port memory using SystemVerilog and the UVM methodology. The memory supports read and write operations across multiple address locations, and its behavior was verified under different stimulus scenarios including sequential, random, and repeated access patterns. A layered UVM testbench was developed consisting of sequence items, sequences, driver, monitor, agent, environment, and scoreboard to ensure modularity and reusability. Constrained-random stimulus generation was used to validate normal operation as well as corner cases such as back-to-back writes, read-after-write, and reset conditions.

A self-checking scoreboard with a reference memory model was implemented to track write transactions and validate read data accurately. Valid-bit tracking was used to differentiate between written and unwritten memory locations, preventing false mismatches due to X-state propagation. The monitor sampled DUT signals synchronously with the clock to ensure cycle-accurate observation, and comparisons were performed using 4-state checking for robustness. Functional coverage was collected to measure address, data, and operation coverage, achieving high confidence in memory correctness and verification completeness.
